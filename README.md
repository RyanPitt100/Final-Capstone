This repository contains the principal component analysis for the popular USArrests dataset. It aims to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to gleam only the relevant variables and uses Kmeans and hierarchical clustering to visualise the data. 

A PCA is important in order to interpret data as it simplifies the complexity for datasets that have a high complexity while retaining trends and patterns. As such when applying predictive models it can be a tremendously effective practice.
